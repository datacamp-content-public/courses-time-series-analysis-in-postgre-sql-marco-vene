`@script`
In the last exercise, you learnt the ```filter``` and  ```group by``` operations that allowed you to compute the sum of tickets sold by week in the months of January and February. 
In this lesson, you will expand your knowledge set and learn the most relevant aggregate functions for analyzing time series. 
With these new functions, you will be able to compute quickly key summary statistics and get additional insights from your data. Let’s dig into it!

## Code from last exercise

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "60ddf54fc4"
```

`@part1`
Weekly Ticket Sales
```sql
SELECT
EXTRACT(year FROM timestamp_checkout) as year,
EXTRACT(week FROM timestamp_checkout) as week,
SUM(tickets) as tickets_sum
FROM sales
WHERE timestamp_checkout BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-02-28'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```


`@part2`
| year | week | tickets_sum |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 2018 | 1    | 29          |
| 2018 | 2    | 18          |
| 2018 | 3    | 13          |
| 2018 | 4    | 6           |
| 2018 | 5    | 38          |
| 2018 | 6    | 22          |
| 2018 | 7    | 18          |
| 2018 | 8    | 14          |
| 2018 | 9    | 4           |


`@script`
Last lesson, we created a weekly report of the ticket sales in the first two months of 2018. After receiving the report, the CEO became interested in uncovering more insights on the weekly behavior of our customers. 
In particular, he would like to understand the distribution of the ticket sales per transaction in the different weeks.

## Summary statistics

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "70c450faef"
```

`@part1`
- `AVG()`: arithmetic mean {{1}}
- `MIN()`: minimum {{1}}
- `MAX()`: maximum {{1}}


`@part2`
Weekly Customer Transaction Report{{2}}

```sql
SELECT
EXTRACT(year FROM timestamp_checkout) as year,
EXTRACT(week FROM timestamp_checkout) as week,
sum(tickets) as tickets_sum,
AVG(tickets) as tickets_avg,
MIN(tickets) as tickets_min,
MAX(tickets) as tickets_max
FROM sales
WHERE timestamp_checkout BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-02-28'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
;
``` {{2}}


`@script`
PostgreSQL offers a handy set of functions to compute key summary statistics for a distribution. Here you can see three important functions to compute the mean and the most extreme data points of a variable. 

With these, we can add additional stats to our weekly sales report and get insights on the typical basket size per transactions and potential outliers.

## Other rounding methods relevant for time series

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "ba524527f4"
```

`@part1`
```sql
SELECT
EXTRACT(week FROM timestamp_checkout) as week,
AVG(tickets) as tickets_avg,
ROUND(AVG(tickets)) as round_0,
ROUND(AVG(tickets),1) as round_1
FROM sales
WHERE timestamp_checkout BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-02-28'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
```


`@part2`
| week | tickets_avg        | round_0 | round_1 |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 1    | 4.1428571428571429 | 4         | 4.1        |
| 2    | 2.5714285714285714 | 3         | 2.6        |
| 3    | 1.4444444444444444 | 1         | 1.4        |
| 4    | 1.2000000000000000 | 1         | 1.2        |
| 5    | 4.2222222222222222 | 4         | 4.2        |
| 6    | 3.6666666666666667 | 4         | 3.7        |
| 7    | 2.2500000000000000 | 2         | 2.3        |
| 8    | 2.8000000000000000 | 3         | 2.8        |
| 9    | 1.3333333333333333 | 1         | 1.3        |


`@script`
When computing aggregate functions, by default PostgreSQL outputs numeric values with many decimals. This is in most of the cases not the optimal display of your data.
With the round function you can round numeric values with as many decimals as you prefer and get a cleaner report. The round function take as first argument a numeric value and as second argument the number of decimal places you want.
